Morse Code Training Application

TODO:
User Interface - Darcy
• Morse character buttons
• Backspace button
• Return button
• Display panel
• etc. (Possible menu interface as initialView? Could practice basic geometrical animation with this.)

Logic - Christopher
• What happens when we press "return/send/nextChar"
  - Write a function that has input string consisting of -s and .s and return corresponding char as the function's output
• How do we implement spaces when we want to implement phrases?

Practice View Code - Jerry
• Link "database" of words to use in application
  - We can start by just using all the letters and numbers, and the words "Hello" and "World" to make phrase "Hello World"
• Write morse to text and/or text to morse translation code after logic is solved

Menu View Code - William
• Animation?
• Import image assets to use as buttons (Circles with text inside)
• Click on circle and more circles pop up as options... (Enlarge with anchor)


Other ideas to implement:
