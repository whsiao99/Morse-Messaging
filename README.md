Ideas:
Morse Code Training Application
We are starting off by creating a custom Morse Code keyboard (yes, these exist in downloadable forms already but we are making our own)
In the end we might scrap the keyboard and place the 'typing interface' right in the view of our application

TODO:
Decide how we want to distinguish different letter entries
- Time threshold
  - Pros: User will eventually become familiarized with standard morse code timings
  - Cons: User may often hesitate between inputs, resulting in many mistakes
- System determines all possible letter combinations of entered morse sequence
  - Pros: We get to practice using Dictionary APIs and create algorithms and whatnot
  - Cons: Difficult to implement, slower calculation
Find or Create database of words to use in application
Write morse to text and/or text to morse translation code
Design User Interface
